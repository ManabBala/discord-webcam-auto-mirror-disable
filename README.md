# Discord Webcam Auto Mirror Disabler

## Issue:-

Discord always mirror the webcam feed of client in the room/channel preview section as like someone is looking into a mirror. This is normal to many other app like zoom, google meet etc.

But If someone's webcam already mirroring the feed itself or for use of "OBS Virtual Webcam" this behaviour is not needed/annoying. There is no way of discord knowing if the feed is a virtual webcam or not.

## Solution:-

There is no option to toggle this functionality in "Discord". So I made this extension which will delete the "mirror" class form the video element thus showing the actual feed from the "Virtual Cam".

## How to Use this Extension:-

- I don't have developer account to upload this extension in "Chrome Extension Store". Need to be installed manually
- Download all the contents of this repo into a folder
- Open Chrome Extension Manager: [Click Here](chrome://extensions/)
- Turn on "Developer Mode" form the top-right section
- Click "Load Unpacked" and browse to the previously downloaded folder and load the extension
- You are ready to go.....
