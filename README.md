# Discord Webcam Auto Mirror Disabler

## Issue:-

Discord always mirror the webcam feed of client in the room/channel preview section as like someone is looking into a mirror. This is normal to many other app like zoom, google meet etc.

But If someone's webcam already mirroring the feed itself or for use of "OBS Virtual Webcam" this behaviour is not needed/annoying. There is no way of discord knowing if the feed is a virtual webcam or not.

## Solution:-

There is no option to toggle this functionality in "Discord". So I made this extension which will delete the "mirror" class form the video element thus showing the actual feed from the "Virtual Cam".
